Input - Bird Y, bird to Top pipe pos, bird to Bottom pipe pos

output - jump how much

activation function - Tan H, hyperbolic tangen function, out neuron value can be rounded between the TanH (-1, 1) and the value if it is more than 0.5 then we jump 

population size - values is as you need, but letss tkae 100 and gen0 and random neural network and take the best of gen0 and breed them make gen1 100 birds

fitness function - every frame that gets furthest gets a point with reference to each frames. ergo = Distance is the fitness funct for nect GEN

Max generations we want for run for - 30 if i make it past 30 gens we will cut and restart the AI [program since it seems innefficient
